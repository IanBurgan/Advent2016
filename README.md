In order to make it onto the top 100 leaderboard,
I solved the problems as quickly as I can. As you can imagine,
this led to less than beautiful code and maybe even sometimes,
dare I say it, bad practices. I apologize in advance.

## Leaderboard Position:

Only the first 100 completions are displayed on the public leaderboard.
For any ranks greater than 100, you're just going to have to trust me. Rank 1
is my ranking on the first star. Similarly, Rank 2 is my ranking on the second
star.
